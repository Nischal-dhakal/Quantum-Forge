ConceptSnap – Learn by Explaining Platform
Week 1 – Problem Understanding & Project Setup

Objective
Establish a clear learning problem, identify target learners, and set up the project workspace to support structured learning design, collaboration, and rapid prototyping throughout the 6-week bootcamp and hackathon.

Key Activities
•	Studied core learning science principles such as active recall, learning-by-teaching, and formative feedback
•	Analyzed existing learning platforms (video-based courses, quiz apps, note-taking tools) to identify gaps in deep conceptual understanding
•	Defined the core learning problem related to surface-level memorization
•	Identified the target learner group and their academic challenges
•	Set up GitHub for version control and project code management
•	Created a Notion workspace for task planning, milestones, and weekly progress tracking

Problem Definition
Many students rely heavily on memorization rather than true understanding. While they may watch videos or read notes, they struggle to explain concepts in their own words, which leads to weak long-term retention and poor performance in exams. Existing platforms often test answers but do not evaluate conceptual clarity or reasoning.
Students lack a simple, guided platform that encourages them to actively process knowledge and receive meaningful feedback on their understanding.

Proposed Solution
ConceptSnap — a learning platform that helps students master topics by asking them to explain concepts in their own words. The platform provides structured prompts, compares student explanations with ideal concept summaries, and offers clear, age-appropriate feedback to improve understanding and clarity.
The focus is on learning by explaining, not memorizing.

Target Learners
•	Students aged 12–17
•	Middle school and high school learners
•	Students learning STEM and theory-heavy subjects (science, math, social studies)
•	Learners who struggle with understanding concepts despite studying

Initial Feature Scope
•	Concept explanation prompts (e.g., “Explain photosynthesis in your own words”)
•	Text-based student explanation submission
•	AI-assisted feedback on clarity, missing points, and misconceptions (prototype level)
•	Side-by-side comparison of student explanation and simplified ideal explanation
•	Topic-wise progress tracking to show improvement over time
•	Clean, distraction-free, student-friendly UI

Deliverables Completed
✅ Project idea finalized and documented
✅ Learning problem and learner needs clearly defined
✅ Target learner group and educational focus identified
✅ GitHub repository initialized with base structure
✅ Notion workspace set up for planning, task tracking, and weekly goals

Outcome
By the end of Week 1, ConceptSnap is grounded in a strong educational foundation focused on deep learning and conceptual understanding. The project has a clearly defined problem, a well-scoped solution, and an organized workflow prepared for prototyping and user experience design in the upcoming weeks.
Next Focus (Week 2)
•	Define user journeys for students explaining and reviewing concepts
•	Finalize core feature prioritization for MVP
•	Design low-fidelity wireframes and interaction flows
•	Plan feedback logic and explanation comparison strategy
